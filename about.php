                        <h2>Hi, I'm Arman ðŸ‘‹</h2><p></p><p><strong>I have more than 9 years of experience in designing qualified websites and applications for different platforms, according to the principles and techniques of user experience.</strong></p>
                        <p>Over these years, I have been trying to consider the needs of the user, through stories and visual images, and also create empathy in the workflow, and coordinate my thinking design to help getting shaped the development of products and services based on user needs.</p>
                        <p>I've always been looking to learn and strive to improve myself, and along the way with a strong background in UI / UX design and strategic planning, from prototyping to creating a visual design language, I'm also trying to increase the value of the product and brand. It helps me to play my role as a designer properly.</p>
